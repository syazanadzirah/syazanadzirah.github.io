<img border="3" src="images/family1.jpg" width="40%" height="50%" align"center">This is one of the most
precious picture of my small family. There is my father, my mother, my younger brother and of course however
without my older brother. This picture was taken in December 2019 which is exactly one year ago at 
Jabal Magnet, Medina when we were performing Umrah together. Jabal Magnet is literally one of my 
favourite location at Medina because there are so much activities to do such as atv drive and Jabal Magnet
has its own miracle which its has magnet on road so the vechile doesn't need to use gear and others.

My father is a reliable, confident 
and full of love for his family.  He often 
advised his children with gentle words but 
he was also firm in educating his children in 
religious chapters especially involving prayer. 
My father also often told us that if there 
was a need to buy, he would try to meets 
everything.  I love my father so much!

My mother is a very loving and caring 
person to her children.  She will ensure 
that every need of her children is well met 
and is always there to advise us.  My 
mother is a person who cares about children's 
education but never pushes us to get good results 
because for her, every results that we got is the 
result of our hard work and will always praise 
our efforts as well as motivate us to try harder.

My oldest brother is a reliable brother, he is a teaser 
but he will take action if his siblings are in trouble.  
He has the characteristics of the eldest son who give in 
over his younger siblings.  He passed away 6 years ago 
due to the motorcycle accident because of irresponsible 
road improvements caused my brother could not be saved.

My younger brother has the characteristics of the 
youngest one because he is spoiled when with family 
but charismatic when with his friends at school and dormitory.  
My younger brother is a comfort in the family because he 
looks like a brother and also has characterics like my 
brother. My younger brother sometimes has its own matured 
but sometimes he just a youngest child in family but I love him.
