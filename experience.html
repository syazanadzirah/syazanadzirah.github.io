<li>My family and I have performed umrah for the first time by using Zaheen Travel service for two weeks. 
On 11 December 2019, we departed from Langkawi Airport to KLIA because the flight to Madinah the next day 
was in the morning so we had to arrive in Kuala Lumpur the day before and on 12 December 2020, 
we left for Madinah by plane for 9 hours.</li>
<br>
<li>We arrived in Madinah at night and after finishing all the affairs at Madinah Airport which took about 2-3 hours, 
we continued to the hotel which is only about 40 meters from the Prophet's Mosque to rest and sightseeing. We were then taken 
to visit the places that have been listed above and explained about the events or history of those places.</li>
<br>
<li>Among my favorite places in Madinah is of course the Prophet's Mosque, which is to enter Rawdah which is very difficult to 
have a chance because it has time and had to fight with many people from all over the world next is Jabal Magnet which has 
a magnetic path and has various activities there. Apart from that, King Fahd Printing Complex is a Quran processing 
and printing factory and got a free Al-Quran per person and I also had the opportunity to go to Quba' Mosque 
which is the first mosque in the history of Islam and visit other mosques such as The Seven Mosque and others.</li>

<li>After being in Madinah for a week, we then took a bus to Mecca for 6 hours 
after stopping at Bir Ali for intention or known as bermiqat. 
After arriving in Mecca in the late afternoon and resting for a while, we went to the Grand Mosque to perform
umrah for the first time by doing tawaf around the Kaaba, saie, shaving and following the rules that is orderly 
and perfect my first umrah. We assisted for 3 umrah and after that, we can perform umrah as much as possible.</li>
<br>
<li>Next, we were taken to visit various places in the Grand Mosque such as the residence of Rasulullah and 
The Well Zamzam and outdoor pilgrimage which are various places of events in Islamic history such as 
Gua Hira 'in Jabal Nur, Gua Tsur, Jabal Rahmah as well as Padang Arafah which is a place for pilgrims. 
In addition, we visited the Factory of Kaaba 'Kiswa to see the processing of the cobweb as well as visit 
the museum which houses the culture and way of life of the Arabs in various other places that have been listed above.</li>
<br>
<li>During the 20 years of my life, the experience of performing umrah for the first time with family members is 
the most beautiful experience and memory that I will never forget and my hope is that this experience is not the last for me.</li></td>
